# Spire
## Overview
Wearable for health and productivity that tracks state of mind, breath and activity.

Spire builds respiration sensing wearables that take bio-sensing beyond activity into mental health, productivity, mindfulness and chronic disease management. Our product changes lives.

Spire’s first product, a consumer wearable available at https://www.spire.io, Amazon and Apple, uses respiratory patterns to infer a wearer’s state-of-mind (tense, calm, focused). The app provides feedback that's been proven to lower tension and increase calm and focus in everyday life. Clinical applications of the device and technology are currently being piloted.
