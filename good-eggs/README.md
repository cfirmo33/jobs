# GoodEggs

## Overview
Founded in July 2011, Good Eggs has aimed to make it easier for people to buy organic foods produced by independent farmers and other local vendors. The service works something like delivery startup Instacart, but is focused only on locally sourced organic and sustainable produce, meats and other items. Online, customers can shop nearby farms and vendors, then Good Eggs handles packaging those orders and delivering them to customers.
