# ❄️ Snowflake ❄️

## Overview
Started with an ambitious goal: to reinvent the data warehouse. We saw the need to create a completely new data warehouse that could bring together all users, all data and all workloads in a single cloud service.
To achieve that, we have assembled a team of experts: https://www.snowflake.net/about/team in data processing who hold over 120 patents in the fields of database architecture, data warehouses, query optimization and parallelization.

## Culture
#### Put Customers First
We only succeed when our customers succeed. Work every day to earn our customers’ business and trust. Listen to our customers, understand their needs and pain points, and focus on what matters to them. Deliver products our customers love. Compete fairly and passionately.

#### Integrity Always
Be open, honest, and respectful. Speak up and communicate candidly, even when it makes you uncomfortable or may be something others don’t want to hear. Constructive, respectful disagreement and debate encourages better problem-solving and decisions. Commit fully when decisions are made.

#### Think Big
Be ambitious and have big goals. Do what matters and focus on what’s important. Innovate and be willing to take smart risks. Make a positive impact and a lasting difference. Plan to win, play to win, and expect to win.

#### Be Excellent
Quality and excellence count in everything we do. Do your best work every day. Hold yourself and others to the highest standards. Common sense, creativity, practicality, and simplicity matter. Think strategically, balancing today and tomorrow.

#### Get It Done
Results matter! Work hard and smart. Execute. Be precise and accountable, yet nimble and agile. Make commitments, follow through, and deliver.

#### Own It
Build our product and company like it’s yours – because it is. Hold yourself and others accountable at all times. Take initiative and ownership. Be responsible – step up, own issues, and resolve them. If you make a mistake, own it, fix it, and move on.

#### Make Each Other the Best
Treat people with kindness and respect. Be inclusive and collaborative; bring people and ideas together. Offer help and ask for help when needed. Listen. Give and ask for constructive feedback. Give praise and celebrate success. Teach and learn every day. Inspire others with your actions.
