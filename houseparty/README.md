# Houseparty

## Overview
A live video streaming app where individuals can chat and connect with friends on a synchronous social network. Unlike Facebook live and Twitter's Periscope, they are ditching public broadcasts for private group chats. Within just a few days after being released in the app store, Houseparty rose to No. 2 in top downloaded charts and gained about 1 million users.
