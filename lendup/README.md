# LendUp
## Overview

LendUp is a financial technology startup, based in San Francisco, working to expand credit access and services to a demographic underserved by traditional lenders. We’re a Y-Combinator alum (YC W12) backed by prominent investors such as Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins and many more. We currently have over 200 employees and continue to grow exponentially.

Millions of people don’t have access to the credit they deserve. Their options for borrowing money are unfair and limited, and it’s easy to become trapped in a downward debt spiral.
Our first product, the LendUp Ladder, is an alternative to payday loans that provides an opportunity to access credit at lower interest rates over time which furthers LendUp's goal of improving financial literacy and providing customers with an opportunity to build their credit scores. Our second product, the L Card, is a credit card (currently in beta) that provides best-in-class technology to a customer group that’s often overlooked.
We are continuing to build the next generation of dignified financial products that we all deserve — giving us back our time, money and control of our financial well-being.
