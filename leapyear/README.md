# LeapYear
## Overview
LeapYear has developed the first secure machine intelligence platform. We have partnered with one of the largest health insurance companies in the country, raised $12.6M in capital, and built a team of researchers, engineers, and advisors who are world experts in the intersection of cryptography and machine learning.

LeapYear's team has decades of collective experience with Google, Apple, the Department of Defense, and includes PhD-level cryptographers and machine learning researchers from MIT, Stanford, Cambridge University, and Microsoft Research. We have a strong culture of teaching, learning, and constant improvement.

We are advised by Enrique Salem, former CEO of Symantec, Hans Morris, former President of VISA, and Aaron Roth, former advisor to Apple and world expert in differentially private machine learning.
