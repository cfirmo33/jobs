# MindMeld
## Overview
MindMeld has pioneered the development of technology to power a new generation of intelligent conversational interfaces. MindMeld was founded in 2011 by Tim Tuttle. A former AI researcher from MIT and Bell Labs, Tim saw how recent advances in AI would enable breakthrough applications driven by natural language, touch and gesture. After 3 years of technology development and 10 patents, MindMeld launched its core offering, the MindMeld platform, in 2014. MindMeld is the first platform that makes it possible for companies to create intelligent conversational interfaces for any app or device. MindMeld has been widely recognized as a leader in the field of natural language understanding and was named by Entrepreneur Magazine as one of the "100 Brilliant Companies" of 2015 and by MIT Technology Review as one of the world's "50 Smartest Companies" of 2014.
