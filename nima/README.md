# Nima
## Overview
Nima is developing breakthrough consumer products enabling users to know what is in their food. Nima believes meal time should be about the enjoyment of your food and your company, and not the worry about potential repercussions of eating something unknown.

Nima has 8M in total funding from a seed round and a 4M venture round last year, and are releasing Nima, their first product (the sensor that tests the food you eat in September)

Product - Nima will first test for Gluten... you put the food in, it mashes it all up, adds chemicals that react to the gluten, then shows if it's safe to eat.
