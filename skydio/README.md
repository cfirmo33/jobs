# Skydio
## Overview
Led by the founders of Google [x]â€™s Project Wing, Skydio is creating an artificially intelligent auto-pilot system for drones. Rather than the standard GPS signal and dedicated pilot, Skydio relies on computer vision to allow drones to be maneuvered by waving a mobile phone.
Andreessen-Horowitz general partner Chris Dixon sees Skydio as complementary to leading drone companies like Airware. Think of Airware as the operating system and Skydio as the most important app on top of the OS.
Their system will ultimately use 4-6 of the same cheap image sensors and processors in mobile phones to give drones the ability to navigate intelligently with respect to their surroundings.
They have existing relationships with the biggest players in the drone market and some of the more interesting small names as well.
