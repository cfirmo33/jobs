# Banjo
## Overview
Banjo has built a proprietary means to aggregate, analyze, and present data posted on public social networks. Using Banjo’s tools, news reports about the identity of the Boston Marathon bomber and the Malaysia Airline missile strike were brought to attention through their media partners before anyone else. Not only is this beneficial for news, you can imagine this technology can be applied to brands, financial services and entertainment. Banjo currently works with companies such as Disney, ESPN, Yahoo, Google, Oreo, the list goes on.
