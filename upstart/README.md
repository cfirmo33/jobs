# Upstart
## Overview
A peer-to-peer lending platform that goes beyond the standard FICO credit score to finance people. They do this on a more personal level, based on signals of their potential, including schools attended, area of study, academic performance and work history. In October, they crossed half a billion dollars in loans - just 2.5 years into offering loans.

The team is founded by several ex-Googlers, including the past President of Google Enterprise. Mark Cuban, Google Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins are just a few of the VC firms backing them. They are ultimately looking to become the "Google Maps" of Finance - where you can see where you are financially at all times and are continuing to make discoveries in data.
