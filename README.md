# Intro

Looking for a job should be about your passion, ability to contribute, and doing great work. Instead, it's mired with interviewing tactics, who you know, and how impressive your past job/school was.  

This Repo helps us inject transparency to embody what our [team](https://github.com/letsrockit/jobs/wiki/Team) believes in most, establishing relationships with qualified job seekers!  

Want to see if we've got a job you'll love?  Use the search for anything from city, tech Stack, company name, and more! Try it out and [please send us any feedback you have](mailto:josh@rockitrecruiting.com).
