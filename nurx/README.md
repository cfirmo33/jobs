# Nurx
## Overview
Certain prescriptions shouldn't require people to take time for a drs office visit. Nurx is creating a prescription drug delivery company starting with birth control and PrEP.
The thinking behind it is that the ease of access increases the likelyhood that people seek treatment.

They're founders are a Doctor and Lawyer. Right now they service CA, NYC, slowly rolling into WA. They are planning to roll out to other states within the year.

For many women, safe and timely access to birth control is their most important healthcare need.

The cost of a doctor’s visit can be an insurmountable barrier to getting birth control for many women.

We believe that control over your own healthcare is a human right, and something everyone deserves. Every woman should have convenient access to birth control where and when she needs it.

At Nurx, we know that you don’t have time for another trip to the doctor’s office or the pharmacy. Especially right before that big presentation at work, or that final exam.

We want to challenge the status quo, break down unnecessary barriers and give women more control over their own health.
