# Long Game
## Overview
Long Game is trying to fix the lack of savings problem that overlaps with the $6B lottery industry. They are creating an app that incentivizes people to save money. For every 20$ they put into their savings, they receive 1 lottery ticket. There is a weekly drawing with prizes up to $1M. The app asks to link your bank account to this new savings account. Long Game makes money from the banks as people are depositing money into their savings accounts.
