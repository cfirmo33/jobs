# Sendgrid üìß
## Overview
Founded in 2009 after graduating from the TechStars accelerator program, by 3 developers who were frustrated that their emails weren‚Äôt being delivered.  
Developed a cloud based service/platform that solves the challenge of delivering emails.  
Product: Email as a service with 2 major products - a cloud based platform (to replace email infrastructure for a company) and a marketing platform (for marketers to reach out to customers)
In our 7th year and became profitable in May  
Challenges (scale), growth (new products) and changes (new executive leadership)
Our culture and what sets us apart - the 4H‚Äôs

Happy ‚Äì love what you do; life is more than work
Humble ‚Äì customer-first; ‚Äúwe‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI‚Äù
Honest ‚Äì transparency & integrity
